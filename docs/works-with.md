## Mutation-pattern (PAT-NN) coverage

Layer 1 locks every PAT in synthetically via the jsdom conformance suite under `tests/conformance/`. The table below shows which PATs each framework **additionally** exercises empirically through its Layer 2 harness — the more ✓ cells here, the more real-framework evidence backs up the Layer 1 regression lock. An empty row means no scenario in any harness currently exercises that pattern empirically.

| Pattern | alpine | astro | hotwire | htmx | liveview | livewire | react | solid | svelte | vue3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [PAT-01](mutation-patterns.md#pat-01-pre-existing-target) | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ | ○ |

## How to add a framework to this matrix

1. Scaffold a minimal harness under `conformance/<framework>/` following an existing example (react / vue3 / svelte / solid for CSR SPAs, hotwire / htmx for server-rendered HTML, alpine for directive-only, astro for SSR + hydration).
2. Add a Playwright project + `webServer` entry in `conformance/playwright.config.ts`.
3. Write `conformance/drivers/<framework>.spec.ts` using the shared runners in `conformance/shared/runners.ts`. Declare a `HarnessConfig`, register one `test()` per supported scenario, and delegate the body to `runners[scenarioKey]`. Framework-specific variance (toggle selector, expected assertion type, settle wait) lives in the config, not in duplicated test bodies.
4. Run `npm run conformance:matrix` — the generator updates this file automatically from the new results.
5. If your harness exercises a new mutation pattern not in the catalog, add a `PAT-NN` test under `tests/conformance/` first, then register the scenario (with its PAT ids) in `conformance/shared/scenarios.js` — the single source of truth for scenario → PAT mappings, shared by this generator and the TypeScript drivers.
